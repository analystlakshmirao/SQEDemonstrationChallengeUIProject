## Demo Challenge


#### Project Setup
1. Clone this project.
2. Setup the project in your IDE.
3. Open the index.html file from src/test/resource/files in a browser
4. Copy the url from the browser and update the url value in src/test/resource/config.properties to be the copied url.
5. In src/test/resources update the config.properties file platform for your OS.
6. From command line run mvn clean install -U -DskipTests
7. Make sure you can run the DemoTest and chrome launches.  You may need to update the chromedriver in /src/test/resources/chromedriver/ to the version that works with your browser
   https://chromedriver.chromium.org/

#### Expectations
We will be evaluating
1. Quality of test cases
2. Variety  of testing types (examples: boundary, happy path, negative, etc)
3. Code structure and organization
4. Naming conventions
5. Code readability
6. Code modularity

#### Exercise
1. Use the site at the index.html
2. There are helper locators provided for you in the src/test/resource/files/locators.txt file.
3. In the Read me file, write up all of the test cases you think are necessary to test the sample page.  Please note any defects or issues observed in the Read me file.
4. Code up a few examples of 
  - At least one happy path case placing an order
  - At least one error case
5. When complete please check your code into a public git repo

Requirements:
-------------------------------- 
 
Maximum Quantity: There are currently no limits set, but for boundary testing letâ€™s assume 5.
Max length of field names: Name,Email and Phone is currently set at 100.

Observations:
-------------------------------- 

1. App lets the user select same topping for both Toppings1 and Toppings2. 
2. Payment Information - Its a radio button and only one option should be selectable. I am able to place an order with both options selected
3. Quantity field is allowing negative quantity which seems to be incorrect 
4. Clicking the Reset button does not reset fields Toppings 1 and Toppings 2
5. Email field does not check for valid domain name, and accepts an email address without @ symbol/
6. Phone number field accepts alphanumeric characters
7. Fields Pizza and Payment Information should be mandatory. If either of the fields is missing the order can still be placed
8. If a guest selects a Pizza with 1 Topping, only one of Toppings drop down should be enabled
